You should now be able to build an offscreen rendering only version of
ldglite for use on a headless server box.  The MESA Offscreen library
(OSMesa) doesn't use X and should build without it.  Here's how:

Grab the latest ldglite sources from CVS.  This gets you a new
makefile makefile.osmesa and a file osmglut.c containing stubs for the
unused glut functions.

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ldglite.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ldglite
checkout ldglite

Grab the latest mesa sources and install it in the ldglite/Mesa-5.0.1
directory.

Cd into the Mesa directory and configure it to build without X and
include static versions of the libraries.

  cd Mesa-5.0.1
  ./configure --without-x --enable-static

To get large images with the offscreen MESA driver
you'll need to edit the MESA config file src/config.h and change
MAX_WIDTH and MAX_HEIGHT from 2048 to something bigger.

Build the GL OSMesa and GLU libraries.

  cd src
  make
  cd ../src-glu
  make

Drop down into the ldglite directory and build it with OSMesa.  Strip
the executable to reduce the size down to about 2.5 MB.

  cd ../..
  make -f makefile.osmesa
  strip ldglite

I tried this method on a linux box and it seemed to work for offscreen
rendering.  BSD should be just about the same, although you may need
to manually add -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/pth to the PNG_LIBS
line to pull in the PNG and ZLIB libraries.

  PNG_FLAGS=-I/usr/local/include -DUSE_PNG
  PNG_LIBS= -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/pth -lpng -lz

You also may need to use gmake on BSD instead of make.  Since it's all
software rendering, an OSX build should not be much different from a
BSD build.

If you want to use dynamic libs you'll have to edit the makefile and
remove the -static linker directive.  You'll probably have to install
the shared libraries by following the instructions in the
Mesa-5.0.1/doc/INSTALL file.
